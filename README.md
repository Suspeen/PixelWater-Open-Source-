# PixelWater-Open-Source-
PixelWater is an open-source project that combines electronics, fluid mechanics, and creative technology to create visual effects with falling water. Using an Arduino-based controller, 16 solenoid valves, and a strobe LED light, the system generates floating images, patterns, and animations with columns of water in mid-air.
